# Python 3D Game Engine

This is the a third refactor of my 3d engine, this time with opengl.

This 3D engine is made using proprietary c++ OpenGL and SDL code.

# TODO:

 - Add Texture object/system.

 - Add Sprite object and Object2D object for 2D games/HUD.

# Future Plans:

 - Switch to Vulkan.
