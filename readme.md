# Python 3D Game Engine

This is the a third refactor of my 3d engine, this time with opengl.

This 3D engine is made using proprietary c++ OpenGL and SDL code.

# Future Plans:

 - Switch to Vulkan.

# TODO:

 - Add `Material` class for wrapping shader programs and their uniforms.  replace shader pointer in object with Material pointer.

 - Move shader linking function to material constructor.

 - Make more flexible setup system that supports github actions.

 - Make event system more robust.  eg: Allow for multiple key-presses at once.
